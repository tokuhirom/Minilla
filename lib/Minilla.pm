=head1 NAME

Minilla - CPAN module authoring tool

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    minil new     - Create a new dist
    minil test    - Run test cases
    minil dist    - Make your dist tarball
    minil install - Install your dist
    minil release - Release your dist to CPAN
    minil run     - Run arbitrary commands against build dir

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Minilla is a CPAN module authoring tool. Minilla provides L<minil> command for authorizing a CPAN distribution.

    (M::I - inc) + shipit + (dzil - plugins)

B<THIS IS A DEVELOPMENT RELEASE. API MAY CHANGE WITHOUT NOTICE>.

=head1 MOTIVATION

=head1 CONVENTION

As stated above, Minilla is opinionated. Minilla has a bold assumption and convention like the followings, which are almost compatible to the sister project L<Dist::Milla>.

=over 4

=item Your module written in Pure Perl are located in I<lib/>.

=item Your executable file is in I<script/> directory, if any

=item Your module is maintained with B<Git> and C<git ls-files> matches with what you will release

=item Your module has a static list of prerequisites that can be described in L<cpanfile>

=item Your module has a Changes file

=back

=head1 GETTING STARTED

    # First time only
    % cpanm Minilla
    # Minilla has only a few deps. It should be very quick

    # Make a new distribution
    % minil new Dist-Name
    % cd Dist-Name/

    # Git commit
    % git commit -m "initial commit"

    # Hack your code!
    % $EDITOR lib/Dist/Name.pm t/dist-name.t cpanfile

    # Done? Test and release it!
    % minil release

It's that easy.

You already have distributions with L<Module::Install>, L<Module::Build>, L<Dist::Zilla> or L<ShipIt>? Migrating is also trivial. See "MIGRATING" in L<Minilla::Tutorial> for more details.

=head1 WHY MINILLA?

=head2 Repository managed by Minilla is git install ready.

The repository created and managed by Minilla is git install ready.
You can install the library by C<< cpanm git://... >>.

Of course, you can install Minilla from C<< cpanm git://github.com/tokuhirom/Minilla.git >>.

=head2 Minilla is built on small libraries.

Minilla is built on only few small libraries. You can install Minilla without a huge list of dependencies to heavy modules.

=head2 And, what is Minilla?

    Minilla is a Kaiju (Japanese giant monster) from the Godzilla series of films and is the first of several young Godzillas.
    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minilla

=head1 CONFIGURATION

Minilla uses B<Convention over Configuration>.

But, you can write configurations to I<minil.toml> file in L<TOML|https://github.com/mojombo/toml> format. Minilla reads the I<minil.toml> file in the root directory of your project.

=over 4

=item name

You can write 'name' instead of automatically detecting project name out of the directory name.

=item readme_from

    readme_from="lib/My/Foo.pod"

You can specify the file to generate the README.md. This is a main module path by default.

=item abstract_from

    abstract_from="lib/My/Foo.pod"

Grab abstract information from the file contains pod.

=item authors_from

    authors_from="lib/My/Foo.pod"

Grab authors information from the file contains pod.

=item authority

    authority = "cpan:TOKUHIROM"

Set x_authority attribute to META.
See L<http://jawnsy.wordpress.com/2011/02/20/what-is-x_authority/> for more details.

=item allow_pureperl

    allow_pureperl=1

A bool indicating the module is still functional without its XS parts.  When an XS module is build
with C<--pureperl_only>, it will otherwise fail.

It affects to L<Module::Build> 0.4005+ only.

=item no_github_issues

    no_github_issues=true

Minilla sets bugtracker as github issues by default. But if you want to use RT, you can set this variable.

=item no_index

    [no_index]
    directory=['t', 'xt', 'tools']

Minilla sets META.json's no_index as C<< directory => ['t', 'xt', 'inc', 'share', 'eg', 'examples', 'author'] >>
by default. But if you want to change them, you can set this section variable. If this section is set,
specified variables are only used, in fact default settings are not merged.

=item c_source

    c_source = ['src']

A directory which contains C source files that the rest of the build may depend
on.  Any ".c" files in the directory will be compiled to object files.
The directory will be added to the search path during the compilation and
linking phases of any C or XS files.

=item script_files

    script_files = ['bin/foo', 'script/*']

Minilla sets install script files as C<< ['script/*', 'bin/*'] >> by default.

=item license

    license="artistic_2"

You can specify your favorite license on minil.toml. The license key is same as CPAN Meta spec 2.0.
See L<CPAN::Meta::Spec>.

=item badges

    badges = ['travis', 'coveralls']

Embed badges image (e.g. Travis-CI) to README.md. It ought to be array and each elements must be service name. Now, supported services are only 'travis' and 'coveralls'.

=item PL_files

Specify the PL files.

    [PL_files]
    lib/Foo/Bar.pm.PL="lib/Foo/Bar.pm"

=item build.build_class

Specify a custom Module::Build subclass.

    [build]
    build_class = builder::MyBuilder

=item FileGatherer.exclude_match

    [FileGatherer]
    exclude_match=['^author_tools/.*']

Nothing by default. To exclude certain files from being gathered into dist, use the
C<exclude_match> option. Files matching the patterns are not gathered.

=item FileGatherer.include_dotfiles

    [FileGatherer]
    include_dotfiles=false

By default, files will not be included in dist if they begin with a dot. This goes
both for files and for directories.

In almost all cases, the default value (false) is correct.

=item release.pause_config

    [release]
    pause_config="/path/to/some/.pause"

By setting this value to another PAUSE configuration file (see
L<cpan_upload/CONFIGURATION> for the details), it is possible to use another
PAUSE server (or anything good enough to mimick its upload process) for the
release step.

To do so, simply add a C<upload_uri> entry in your file to the alternate PAUSE
server, i.e :

    upload_uri http://127.0.0.1:5000/pause/authenquery

Note that this feature is not officially documented in L<CPAN::Uploader>.

=head1 FAQ

=over 4

=item How can I manage B<contributors> section?

Minilla aggregates contributors list from C<< git log --format="%aN <%aE>" | sort | uniq >>.

You can merge accounts by .mailmap file. See L<https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-shortlog.html>

=item Why don't you provide plug-in support?

If you want to pluggable thing, it's already exist dzil :P
And if you like a behavior like Minilla, you can use L<Dist::Milla>, the sister project of Minilla.
L<Dist::Milla>'s behavior is mostly like Minilla.

=item Why minil only supports git?

I think git is a best VC for CPAN modules, for now.

If you want to use another version control system, you can probably use L<Dist::Milla>.

=item And why...

Yes. You can use L<Dist::Milla>.

=item Should I add (META.json|Build.PL) to repository?

Yes. You need to add it to make your git repo installable via cpanm.

=item How do I manage ppport.h?

Is there a reason to remove ppport.h from repo?

=item How can I install script files?

Your executables must be in F<script/>. It's L<Module::Build::Tiny>'s rule.

=item How to switch from Module::Install/Module::Build/Dist::Zilla?

You can use experimental `minil migrate` sub-command.
See L<Minilla::CLI::Migrate> for more details.
